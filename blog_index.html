				<h4>Wireframing Uncrate.com</h4>
					This is one of my favorite sites because it is simple, sleek, and smooth. There is no bs, just elegant black and white primarily. No fancy fonts or color. Starting from the top on the left side, you have links to other similar sites. On the top right, you have easy access to Facebook and Twitter buttons to share. Your eyes get pulled directly to the name of the website which is the largest font on the page. Then the navigation bar is designed in such a way that not only does it distinguish its presence but doesn't cause too much distraction away from the rest of the page. Out of the two rows of the navigation bar, the top one has more links to direct findings that can take you to where you want to go quickly. The second row has links to more broad topics such as "most wanted" or "random thing". Uncrate.com does a great job with the title and navigation bar, but your eyes immediately flow downwards, as a huge image of some sort is put, but you can only see it halfway (well, at least on a Macbook). It makes you want to scroll downward and see what the whole image is all about. The website solves the problem of where to find unique "manly" things that men not only can achieve but also dream about. Cool gadgets and products that are exclusive to men's likings. There is always something cool on Uncrate.com no matter when you visit it. The content is down to earth, it seems as though someone is describing it to you in person as well as giving you their own thoughts about it. It usually contains more information, cool facts and data, that immediately catch your attention to read more of it. It is humorous and sarcastic at times with an element of "oh this is so cool". At the end of the content, it usually gives you the price of the product and a link to where you can buy it. It is quite easy to browse through all the content, its pretty much central and vertically placed so as you scroll downwards, you only have to keep your eyes on one place. When your on Uncrate.com, you have a sense of being in a secret club where you get to see the coolest product. Makes you feel special, part of a secret agency, where you discover products first. Some of the content is a fantasy, not something that is really practical for the "average joe", for example a $20,000 watch case. The site provides links to where you can buy the product, once you have the money for it that is!

				<h4>Wireframing Google.com</h4>
					Once of the most widely used websites of all time, Google.com is awesome. When you first arrive at the page, it is simple, but undercover it is a very powerful website. Your eyes immediately travel to the center at the Google logo, with the search bar underneath it. There are only two buttons at the bottom, one that says "Google Search" and the second one that says "I'm Feeling Lucky". Personally speaking, I've almost never used the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, and I'm sure a lot of people haven't either so it comes to a surprise that it is still there. As social sites like Facebook and Twitter have gained significance, Google has been quick to introduce their own social networking site Google+. At the top right corner, you can access you profile, your Gmail, images, apps, and notifications. The top right corner is like a special access to your own stuff. As we look at the bottom, to the left there is all the business and advertising stuff. And at the bottom right corner, there is all the privacy and terms links as well as the settings to tailor Google to you. There is not much color on the page besides the Google logo and a lot of whitespace so you focus on whats important and that is, the Google search. The search helps solve the problem of looking for stuff on the Internet. Your simple Google search, with the right words, can immediately give you access to what you are looking for, such as the phone number to your local bakery shop. The content of this site is very powerful, you just have to type the right words to narrow down the billions of things on the Internet. The content on the website is placed equally, so you have no trouble scanning the content to see what exactly it is that you're looking for. Each search returns a page broken down into separate links for sites. Under each link, there is a short description to help you gage whether this site could be useful to you or not before you click on it. The content varies from what you search so the feel for it is very dependent on your search. Since Google.com is very simple and not much feel to it, what you search is how you feel, primarily based on if you found what you are looking for. If you search for something and find a link to what you are looking for, Google is your best friend forever. Then theres times where you search and search and search, yet you simply cannot find any good articles or links to sites that you are looking for, this is where Google becomes your enemy.

				<h4>Wireframing Yahoo.com</h4>
					As you first arrive at Yahoo.com's website you notice a big rectangular advertisement. It usually is animated so your eyes immediately go there than anything else. I personally, go directly to the close ad box just on the right corner of the ad, not interested in what they are featuring. Back to the top, you have the navigation bar with all the elements of Yahoo, from mail to mobile. Being an international website, you can change the language of Yahoo.com by a button on the top right corner that displays an American flag by default. Below all this is the Yahoo logo and search bar, I personally dont use much. The next thing, which is my absolutely favorite element of the site, is a place where they put the top news at. It is a little hard to describe, but it has a big picture from the article and below it, a little text intro that introduces the article. It usually is a hook line that doesn't give you all the information that is in the article but just the intro of what it is about and if you want to know the rest you have to click the link. Right beneath that is a "rolling image belt" thing that has the same exact picture, just smaller, that was featured right above with a title. This just makes up one of the articles, but there is a picture next to it of the follow article. In this way they have made a "rolling image belt" where you can fast forward through top articles and click on ones that you are interested in. By just putting your mouse over the small image, it syncs the big picture to be the same and you can learn more about the article by seeing its intro. Alright, enough about this "rolling image belt", below this is a long list of articles. The articles are placed in similar form going across the page. Majority of them start with a small icon image to give you a visual reference to what the article might be about, along with a short text description. The scrolling is unlimited so the more you scroll down, more articles appear, kind of like an unlimited page of articles. I would describe the webpage to be very cluttered. You have a lot of stuff going on. Sometimes the ads are annoying, and theirs alot of stuff on the page you don't care for. This website solves the problem of having to search anywhere else for your basic news. It is kind of like a newspaper with articles, weather, sports scores, and trending articles and videos. There are alot of links on this page to many different things, so it could be overwhelming if you are trying to find something specific. It is quite easy to navigate through the page, just depends on what your there for. I typical use Yahoo.com just to read up on trending news. After you are on the website for a while, you might feel overwhelmed with all the articles. I find myself clicking an article and then finding another link to another article, and so on until I get tired of reading.
